# Regression-Models-Project


Looking at a data set of a collection of cars, we are interested in exploring the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon (MPG) (outcome). We are particularly interested in the following two questions:

“Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG” “Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions”
